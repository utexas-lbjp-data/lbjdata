# lbjdata

The goal of lbjdata is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of lbjdata from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("lbjdata")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(lbjdata)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(highcharter)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r provider_chart}
provider_types <- read_csv("https://genesis.soc.texas.gov/files/accessibility/vaccineprovideraccessibilitydata.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  summarise(tot_shipped = sum(total_shipped),
            tot_avail = sum(vaccines_available)) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  arrange(desc(tot_shipped))

provider_types %>% 
  hchart("column", hcaes(x=type, y = tot_shipped, colors=type)) %>% 
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_lbj()) %>% 
  hc_title(text="Vaccine Supply, By Type of Provider") %>% 
  hc_subtitle(text="Source: Texas Department of State Health Services")
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
