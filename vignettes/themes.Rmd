```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(lbjdata)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(highcharter)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r provider_chart}
provider_types <- read_csv("https://genesis.soc.texas.gov/files/accessibility/vaccineprovideraccessibilitydata.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  summarise(tot_shipped = sum(total_shipped),
            tot_avail = sum(vaccines_available)) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  arrange(desc(tot_shipped))

provider_types %>% 
  hchart("column", hcaes(x=type, y = tot_shipped, colors=type),
         name = "Total Shipped: ") %>% 
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_lbj()) %>% 
  hc_title(text="Vaccine Supply, By Type of Provider") %>% 
  hc_subtitle(text="Source: Texas Department of State Health Services")
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
